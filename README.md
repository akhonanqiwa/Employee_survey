### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase I performed the following:
1. Data Loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

I am to analyze this dataset and draw meaningful insight to help the employer make decisions by providing the answers for the questions below: 
- Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most? 
- Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role? 
- As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

### Results/Findings

1. The most agreed question is question 1 "I know what is expected of me at work" by 57%.
   And the most disagreed question is question 6 "I have a best friend at work" by 32%.
2.  Planning and Public Works department appears most often. This shows that this department participate the most in these surveys.
3.  Looking at the trends of this data, the employer should focus more at creating a friendly environment for all employees by
    inventing socializing sessions/events and allow employees to be free around their collegues. 
    And also the employer must emphasize on giving employee feedback on their performances, by doing that it will help employees to improve where they lack. 
    The employer must create mentorship programs and Buddy programs where much experieced employees will be teamed up with
    new or less experienced employees to give support, guidance and career development. 
    Implement regulaur check-ins by encouraging managers to constantly have one-on-one meetings with their team members to discuss
    not only work-related issues but also personal developments and concerns employees might have.
